About the game:
    Each player will select a no. and the game will go in turns.
    Each no. selected will be spoken to other users and will be stored in the list by the no. of the player in the server.
    If other player also selects the same no. the value will not be updated in the server and still the no. will be announced to other users.
    After 135 rounds the player who has highest no. of elements in the server will be declared as winner.
    After 75 no. other no.s are difficult to find, you can give it a try.
